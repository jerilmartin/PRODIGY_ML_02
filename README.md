# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## Quickstart
- **Dependencies**: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Installation**: Run `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`
- **Usage**: Execute `python kmeans_clustering.py` to segment customers into clusters.

## Overview
This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their annual income and spending score. The model identifies the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and visualizes customer segments.

## Data
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Customer data with features for clustering.
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: Script for executing the clustering algorithm.

## Results
- Optimal Clusters: 5
- Clusters are visualized with centroids marked in red.
- Customers are segmented based on scaled annual income and spending score.
